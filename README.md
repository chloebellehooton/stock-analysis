There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
#### Refactoring code makes the program run faster and smoother. It creates a cleaner and more efficient code. With refactoring, your code takes less steps and doesn't use as much memory. There isn't a clear disadvantage to refactoring other than the opportunity cost of doing so. For some smaller scripts that will only be used a few times, it might not be worth the time to go in and change things for the sake of efficiency. Additionally, if someone new is coming in and refactoring, this could break the code which could be quite costly to the project.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
#### Refactoring this was useful because it ran much faster and I ran it for 2 different years so it wasn't a one time script. Also given that I will be sending these to my clients, Steve and his parents, I want to make this code as easy to use as possible. For one, I don't know the memory capabiliities of their computer and we know that Steve is planning to expand the code further so it's best in this case to take the time to refactor it.
